# Testcase-generator
Really wanted to try making one in java, to learn a good amount of file handling
Keep the name of your file logic, followed by the respective extension.

# How to use
Step 1) Open the TCCreation.java file, and write down the format of your test cases. 
Step 2) Place the logic file in the same folder as the Driver.java file. Name this file logic.\*, where \* is the extension of your logic file
Step 3) Run the driver program

In your Command prompt, type the following
1) javac Driver.java
2) java Driver


The code does the rest of the work for you.
