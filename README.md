# Testcase-generator
Really wanted to try making one in java, to learn a good amount of file handling

Keep the name of the file of your code as logic.c
For now, only c files supported
or if you know, you can tweak the code to change the name of the file that you want, if you understand it properly

The OG testcase generator by [Aashutosh Rathi](https://github.com/aashutoshrathi) is here : https://github.com/aashutoshrathi/HackerRank-Test-Case-Generator


# How to use
Place the logic.c file in the same folder as the Driver.java file.
In your Command prompt, type the following
1) javac Driver.java
2) java Driver

The code does the rest of the work for you.
