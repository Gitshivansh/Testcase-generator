# Testcase-generator
Really wanted to try making one in java, to learn a good amount of file handling
Keep the name of your file logic, followed by the respective extension.

# How to use
Open the code, find the input area function.
Print whatever you want in that function.
Place the logic file in the same folder as the Driver.java file.

In your Command prompt, type the following
1) javac Driver.java
2) java Driver


The code does the rest of the work for you.
